# Concurrency Problems on the JVM
## Race Condition
```scala
def runInParallel(): Unit = {
  var x = 0

  val thread1 = new Thread(() => {
    x = 1
  })

  val thread2 = new Thread(() => {
    x = 2
  })

  thread1.start()
  thread2.start()

  println(x)
}

def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  runInParallel()
}
```
⬆️ sometimes prints 1, sometimes prints 2.

### Bank Account Example
```scala
case class BankAccount(var amount: Int)

def buy(bankAccount: BankAccount, thing: String, price: Int): Unit = {
  bankAccount.amount -= price
}

def demoBankingProblem(): Unit = {
  (1 to 10000).foreach { _ =>
    val account = BankAccount(50000)
    val thread1 = new Thread(() => buy(account, "shoes", 3000))
    val thread2 = new Thread(() => buy(account, "iPhone", 4000))
    thread1.start()
    thread2.start()
    thread1.join()
    thread2.join()
    if (account.amount != 43000) println(s"AHA! I've just broken the bank: ${account.amount}")
  }
}
```
As a result, the console prints 2 times out of 10000 iterrations.
```text
AHA! I've just broken the bank: 46000
AHA! I've just broken the bank: 46000
```
⬆️ Example race condition:
- __thread1(shoes)__   reads amount 50000
- __thread1(shoes)__   compute result 50000 - 3000 = 47000
- __thread2(iPhone)__  reads amount 50000
- __thread2(iPhone)__  compute result 50000 - 4000 = 46000
- __thread1(shoes)__   write amount 47000
- __thread2(iPhone)__  write amount 46000

This is because ⬇️ involves 3 steps:
```scala
/*
  involves 3 steps:
  - read old value
  - compute result
  - write new value
*/
def buy(bankAccount: BankAccount, thing: String, price: Int): Unit = {
  bankAccount.amount -= price
}
```
To improve this:
```scala
def buySafe(bankAccount: BankAccount, thing: String, price: Int): Unit = {
  bankAccount.synchronized {  // does not allow multiple threads to run the critical section AT THE SAME TIME
    bankAccount.amount -= price  // ← critical section
  }
}
```
### Exercise
```scala
/**
  1 - create "inception threads"
    thread 1
      -> thread 2
        -> thread 3
          ...
    Each thread prints "hello from thread $i".
    Print all messages IN REVERSE ORDER
*/
// Solution
def inceptionThreads(maxThreads: Int, i: Int = 1): Thread =
  new Thread(() => {
    if (i < maxThreads) {
      val newThread = inceptionThreads(maxThreads, i + 1)
      newThread.start()
      newThread.join()
    }
    println(s"Hello from thread $i")
  })

def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  inceptionThreads(5).start()
}
```
which prints:
```text
Hello from thread 5
Hello from thread 4
Hello from thread 3
Hello from thread 2
Hello from thread 1
```
```scala
/**
  2 - What's the max/min value of x

  max value = 100 - each thread increases x by 1
  min value = 1
    all threads read x = 0 at the same time
    all threads (in parallel) compute 0 + 1 = 1
    all threads try to write x = 1
*/
def minMaxX(): Unit = {
  var x = 0
  val threads = (1 to 100).map(_ => new Thread(() => x += 1))
  threads.foreach(_.start())
}
```
```scala
/**
  3 - "Sleep fallacy": what's the value of message?

  Almost always, message = "Scala is awesome"
  Is it guranteed? NO
  Obnovious situation (possible):

  main thread:
    message = "Scala sucks"
    awesomeThread.start()
    sleep(1001) - yields execution
  awesome thread:
    sleep(1000) - yeild execution
  OS gives the CPU to some important thread, takes > 2s
  OS gives the CPU back to the main thread
  main thread:
    println(message)  //>> "Scala sucks"
  awesome thread:
    message = "Scala is awesome" 
*/
def demoSleepFallacy(): Unit ={
  var message = ""
  val awesomeThread = new Thread (() => {
    Thread.sleep(1000)
    message = "Scala is awesome"
  })

  message = "Scala sucks"
  awesomeThread.start()
  Thread.sleep(1001)

  // to solve the potential problem, we could awesomeThread.join() here
  println(message)
}
```
